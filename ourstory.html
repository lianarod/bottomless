<div id="ourstory"><h2>OUR PHILOSOPHY ON FOOD BEGINS AT THE ROOT.</h2><br>
    We cherish each and every ingredient that goes into our dishes
    by making sure they come from trustworthy and sustainable farmers. We want every dish to be a reflection of our core values
    of a food establishment which is, real, fresh, food. That is why we work hard as a business to source the best possible ingredients and strive to
    meet farmers in the Mid Atlantic Region that meet our qualifications.
    Our menus are aligned with whatever produce and ingredients are in season at that time in addition to matching the demands of our
    customers. We truly do listen to our customers and their input so if you stop by, let us know how we did!<br><br>
    We also recognize that food waste is a big problem in the United States which is why our mission for sustainability is to help reduce that problem
    one restaurant at a time. All food products that are close to their expiration date are used to curate a specialized menu for the
    local food pantry which are then served to those in need. We believe everyone should have access to delicious and nutrient dense food.<br><br>

    Sincerely,<br><br>
    <i>Founder - Liana Rodriguez</i></div>
